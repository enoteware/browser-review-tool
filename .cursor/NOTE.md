# Note: Separate Utility

The files in this `.cursor/commands/` directory are a **separate utility** for initializing projects with Cursor. They are not part of the browser-review-tool itself.

If you want to use the `init-project` command globally across all your projects, you should:

1. **Create a separate repository** for cursor-init-project
2. **Or install it globally** from a separate location
3. **Or copy these files** to `~/.cursor/commands/` for global access

This command is included here for convenience but should ideally be in its own repository.
